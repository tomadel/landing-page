# landing-page


This is my first project with CSS. The code is a bit messy, since I figured out lots of thing on the way. It was a great pleasure to do this project. It helped me a lot to understand how to use flexbox and create a website. 

Overall, I believe that, I'll use cleaner code in my future projects. I really enjoyed this one.
